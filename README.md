### The Idea
#### Did you know?
+	Over 1/3 of all food produced globally goes to waste.
+	The annual value of food wasted globally is $1 trillion, and it weighs 1.3 billion tons.
+	All the world’s nearly one billion hungry people could be fed on less than a quarter of the food that is wasted in the US, UK and Europe.

<p>What if we lessen food/edible goods that are being thrown away by supermarkets, restaurants, food chains and donate them to charitable groups/organizations who are devoted to feeding unfortunate individuals?</p>

### How It Works
#### For Restaurants/Establishments
+	Managers or representative can create an account online.
+	Set your preferred donation frequency afterwards, including the days and time you are willing to meet up with organizations.
+	Wait for organizations to book appointments.
+	You will see your upcoming donations on a rolling week basis in your dashboard.
+	Update your information and frequency when you need.

#### For Charitable Groups
+	Managers or representative can create an account online.
+	Browse from restaurants/establishments with active donation schedule.
+	Click on a restaurant to view their preferred donation time and available appointments for the week and click on a date to book it.
+	You will see your upcoming booked appointments in your dashboard.
+	To check the location and phone number of the restaurant/establishments, click on the restaurant/establishment’s name.
+	Update your information when you need.
